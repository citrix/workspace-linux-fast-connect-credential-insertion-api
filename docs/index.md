# Fast Connect Credential Insertion API for Citrix Workspace app for Linux 1808

The Fast Connect Credential Insertion API provides an interface that supplies user credentials to the Receiver for Linux 13.10 Single Sign-on (SSO) feature. Using this API, Citrix partners can provide authentication and SSO products that use StoreFront to log users on to virtual applications or desktops and then disconnect users from those sessions.

The system requirements and prerequisites for the API are the same as those for Citrix Workspace app.
